# sqlalchemy-challenge
Module 10 Challenge
I had to look up how to do dynamic routes and struggled with it a little bit, but eventually made it work.

I wrote code to determine and store the last date in a variable, but for some reason, it didn't work and threw and error.  I resorted to entering the data manually that I had identified as the last date.

Similarly, I had the same problem with the most active station.  i ended up typing the identification in manually. 

I believe it all works.

The exploratory analysis is in the Jupyter notebook named sqlalchemy_challenge
The app.py file is the file for the flask api
